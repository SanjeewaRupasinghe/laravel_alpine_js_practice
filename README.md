# Introduction

## Laravel

Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Laravel is written in PHP language and has a syntax similar to Ruby on Rails. Laravel is known for its clean and elegant syntax, and its robust set of features.

Laravel is an excellent choice for web applications because of its simplicity, fast development speed, and large community.

More information about Laravel can be found in the [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x).

## Alpine.js

Alpine.js is a lightweight JavaScript framework for building interactive web interfaces. It is designed to be approachable and easy to use, even for beginners. With Alpine.js, you can add interactivity to your web page without writing a single line of JavaScript.

Alpine.js is a great choice for web developers because of its simplicity, small file size, and its ability to enhance the user experience.

More information about Alpine.js can be found in the [Alpine.js Documentation](https://alpinejs.dev/essentials/getting-started).

## Why Laravel with Alpine.js

Laravel and Alpine.js work well together because Laravel provides a powerful framework for building web applications, while Alpine.js provides a simple and intuitive way to add interactivity to your web pages. With Laravel, you can build the backend of your application, and with Alpine.js, you can add interactivity to the frontend.
